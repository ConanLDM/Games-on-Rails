# Games on Rails

Deployed at https://games-on-rails.onrender.com/home

This is a Rails 7 project with a central focus on video games.

The aim is to feature a review system whether it be internally in the project or pulling from an external source (in progress).

Much potential for future features including users sharing their recommendations and a way to connect on the website between friends.

Recently Added (not yet deployed): Real time Turbo comments, Trix Rich Text Editor for Reviews and Stimulus Navbar Drop Down (left navbar) and Hover (right navbar).

Emphasis on Hotwire and vanilla JavaScript rather than an external framework (contains no Bootstrap, Bulma or the likes of React or Tailwind).

Authentication by Devise and Administration by Administrate.
