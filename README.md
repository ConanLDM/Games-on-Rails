# Games on Rails

This is a Rails 7 project with a central focus on video games.

The aim is to feature a review system whether it be internally in the project or pulling from an external source (in progress).

Much potential for future features including users sharing their recommendations and a way to connect on the website between friends.

Emphasis on Hotwire and vanilla JavaScript rather than an external framework.
